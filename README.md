A bit about myself.

I originally graduated in Computer Networking over two decades ago but never got a chance to work in IT up until last year. I have worked in different roles and fields, moving around whereever I'm needed in the company

I'm looking for a career where I can focus on my new qualifications and perfect them, while being able to work remotely. I would enjoy being able to know my role as per my qualifications and focus on that role. I am also interested in investing and I'm hoping to use my new skills to help me better with my investments. 

I enjoy all things tech, new technology always facinates me and I've always loved numbers. The past 10 years I've worked in Insurance and MicroFinance. FinTech allows me combine Finance and Technology and gives me a chance to work in two things I really enjoy while perfecting my skills in the same.
